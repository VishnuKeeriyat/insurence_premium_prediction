### GitHub Repository Description for Health Insurance Premium Prediction

---

**# Health Insurance Premium Prediction**  

This project is a Python-based machine learning application designed to predict health insurance premiums. It leverages key data features to analyze and estimate the cost of premiums for individuals based on specific factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.  

### **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficiently handles data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, to build a robust predictive model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements performance metrics including MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to evaluate the model's accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful heatmaps and plots for data exploration and results analysis.
